# Learning-React
My first React Project!

## Tic-Tac-Toe (Done)
I learned the basic concepts from this project. (Tutorial from <https://zh-hans.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html>)
Just do:
```bash
cd tic-tac-toe
npm install
npm start
```

## UI-Example (In Progress)
My **real** first `React` project. Re-designed parts of a webpage using `Bootstrap`.

To see dev version:
```bash
cd ui-example
npm install
npm start
```

## LICENSE
This project is GPL-3.0 licensed.
Plus, Bootstrap is under the MIT license. (See `/src` in the repo.)
Changed for a little little bit since `npm start` will warn me for unknown name `color-adjust`(actually `print-color-adjust`).
